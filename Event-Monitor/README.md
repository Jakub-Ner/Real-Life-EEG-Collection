# Mind-Collector 
**A tool that enables data acuisition and automatic annotations, while a subject play games like League of Legends.** 

In this way a subject doesnâ€™t need to spend extra time on an experiment, because they play according to their routine. It helps in collecting higher amount of data. Additionally my tool monitors selected parts of the screen (like scoreboard) and triggers keyboard events. It uses this data to annotate mental states according to configured triggers:
